        <p>Louis is an orange tabby. He is almost 9 years old. That make him a senior cat.</p>
        <p>Louis used to have a different home in Pahrump, NV, but his humans couldn't take care of him anymore. A rescue called Foreclosed Upon Pets Inc (FUPI) decided to help him find a new home.</p>
        <p>He spent about 7 months with FUPI in Pahrump. He didn't find his new humans there, so he was moved to Las Vegas to give him a better chance of being adopted.</p>
        <p>In Las Vegas, he lived at a PetSmart store for about a month with a lot of other cats looking for humans.</p>
        <p>One night, two humans came in to say hello to the cats. There were kittens and young cats talking and playing, and they were fun to hang out with.</p>
    <p>But there was one cat in a cage on the bottom who was curled up in a ball asleep.</p>
    <p>The nice humans noticed that he was a lot older than the other cats, which means that he was going to have a harder time finding his forever home. He seemed sort of sad. They decided that they would take him home and become his humans and make him happy again.</p>
    <p>Now Louis lives in a big house with lots of toys. He has a sister named Phoebe to play with. He loves to take naps and sit on his window seat, looking at cars and people outside.</p>
